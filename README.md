# Flight Reservation System Simulation

The Flight Reservation System is a Java-based simulation developed using IntelliJ IDEA and Swing, designed to demonstrate the complete process of booking a specific flight and managing passenger information through a graphical user interface. The system is divided into two main parts, each handled by separate Java files:

-Client_Interface.java: Manages the entire booking process, including entering passenger details, selecting seats, adding services, and processing payments.

-ClientTable.java: Displays a read-only table of all passengers' information, providing a management overview of all bookings for the specific flight.

Booking data is stored and can be accessed on the text file Client_Flight_Info.txt.
